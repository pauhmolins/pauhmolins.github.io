I am a last year student of MSc in *Machine Learning and Cybersecurity for Internet-Connected Systems* at [UPC](https://epsem.upc.edu/en?set_language=en).

I'm currently working with [Georgios Bakirtzis](https://bakirtzis.net/) on mathematical programming and research on game theory for modeling
multi-agent control scenarios with strictly ranked metrics.
